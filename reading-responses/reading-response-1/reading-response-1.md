## Take a Step Backward from the Enthusiasm of Big Data

Before diving into the discourse of *Big Data*, or as the word *data* as we all familiar with in the present, I want to bring a retrospect into the history of statistics, or shall we say statistics in the age of its invention. The modern notion of statistics came into place at a era of great scientific advancement in Western Europe, in 17th-19th centuries, when mathematicians are making great progress in the field of physics, chemistry and natural science in general so that the nature and its mechanisms is expressed and documented in a pure mathematical way. They surged to build up a similar mathematical system that can describe the society as if it is a part of natural science, and so did statistics and probability theories emerged and matured accordingly.

Some might argue that what we perceive as *Big Data* today has essentially no difference than what is used to be called statistics, despite that as the author of [Critical Questions for Big Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UHIPYi6UyY1hSlXQwcxkZ5EQdipexVIx/view) argues that *big data are not always better data* and the existence of false worships towards the intrinsic qualities of big data such as objectiveness, However, the **context** and methods of data collection shifted significantly, and that is the reason that distinguishes the notion of what we known as *big data* nowadays. Traditionally, when conducting the collection of data, there should at least be one process that involves direct human interaction with the actual objects that the data is measuring, yet in the *big data* age, this process is missing. In most cases, personnels who analyzes the data is not the collector, and most collector is the computer networking systems that obviously lack a **contextual** meaning and understanding of the objects measured.

The authors of *Critical Questions for Big Data* used an example of modeling social networks through online data to show that the data of articulated and behavioral networks does not represent what really happened during human interaction without a solid context. In this sense, context could include measurement that cannot be transcribed into numbers, for example, how intimate two persons are. The author of [Data Humanism](http://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold/), different than the previous authors, he holds a generally optimistic prospect for the usage of data. The context he gave with data is indeed humanistic, with the intrinsic aesthetic nature of visualization that he put into his works. In both senses, however, the lack of context can lead to a detachment of meaning. As the authors of *Critical Questions for Big Data* mentioned that one account does not necessarily represent one user, the collection of data is based on accounts. This could lead to some unexpected results and could be consider a loss of context. If a public computer is logged into a Spotify account and the computer is functioned of playing music at a bar, when multiple guests may ask to play certain songs on the computer, then the data end may perceive that one single person is listening to a wide range of genres of songs, yet the context is lost in this scenario.

 If the two authors (two group of authors) want to have a conversation, they might be counter-arguing each other on whether accessing data is a privilege. The authors of *Critical Questions for Big Data* mentioned that having the access to large amount of data is not equally distributed to every one. It is for whom that holds the technological knowledge or capital to be able to access the measurements done in the digital world. But the author of *Data Humanism* did not explicitly disagree with this argument, instead, he tried to bring data and the corresponding tread a sense of emotion and variance in aesthetics. By doing the project **Dear Data**, he is trying to state that even in the age of normalized digital world, collecting data manually gives itself cultural context, at least at the scope of a single person.
