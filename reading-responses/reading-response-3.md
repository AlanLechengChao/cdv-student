## Surveillance Capitalism, Economics-driven Use of Digital Technology?

Unlike what I expected, Zuboff started the definition of **Surveillance Capitalism** from an actual event, rather than a collection of models of abstraction. In this case, she points out that the starting point of Google's prediction advertising as the sign of the emergence of surveillance capitalism. Similar to the historical context of capitalism, where profits is modeled to be collected from the usage of quantifying and exploiting labor force, surveillance capitalism profits from surveilling data from the *users*, with the *users* not being notified properly and in a low cost that brings the corporations with more profits.

During the talk, Zuboff is comparing the practices of surveillance capitalism to **colonialism** that I find very interesting. In the history of colonialism, Zuboff mentioned about how Spaniards attempted to legitimize the acts of exploiting the properties, land and living conditions of indigenous people, they just simply made an announcement in Castilian Spanish that is verified by the European Pope, and manifest as the authorized truth about their rights of colonizing the land of Sound America, without any translators in their language. Zuboff call this as **the fear of unprecedent** and **asymmetry of knowledge** from the perspective of the indigenous people, not knowing anything about what is the weapons used by the colonizers, etc. This is similar to what we encounter as we are constantly being asked of consenting with data collection, yet not knowing what methods are used specifically to collect the data, as if we are interacting with the **black box** (this is also a very classic analogy of asymmetry of knowledge). Thus, according to Zuboff, these unprecedent intruders of either the indigenous people in pre-colonial South America or *Us (the users, yet lacking of a better word to unite the collective voices)*, start with **incursion**, and eventually let us be adapted and redirected with their previous incursion. Just as what [Figure 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a-N_sZDBcS8EC1W2X1awNFyKjv_Z4kcE/view) suggests, that our border of privacy is being gradually violated, not only the scale, but the scope of their surveillance.

Yet all of these discussions are built up upon the premise of surveillance capitalism is essentially driven by economic profits, just as Zuboff again used the example of the reason of Google started with advertisement prediction is for dragging the company out of financial crisis, rather than being ignorant at the ethical redlines questions. Hence, Zuboff urges optimistically for a better future of optimizing the usage of technology that surveil the information for the users, not entirely for the profits. I find this rather difficult to empathize. As they slightly mentioned about China utilizing surveillance not entirely for economic reasons, but more in the field of authoritarian controls, I believe it is not possible to assume that an economic-driven surveillance capitalism will remain solely economic driven when **it** grows to an inhumanely great scale that is not understandable by individuals. The anxiety of the **black box fallacy** will be continued however user-friendly the data collection technology could be, due to the nature of non-humanness computers are, especially with ethical decision.
