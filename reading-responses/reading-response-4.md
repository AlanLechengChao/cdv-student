### 3 Prediction examples
- 1. Sophisticated simulations ran on computers, for example, massive weather forecasting. Simulations like these are mostly built from general laws of natural sciences. Yet uncertainties happen when the system gets extremely complicated and any tiny shifts in parameters may result in something completely different.

- 2. Any personalized prediction that is generated with machine learning algorithms. On instant example I found is when mobile operating systems will collect data from users' behaviors and find corresponding patterns within the data. If bluetooth devices are connected, the phone will predict a behavior of opening up music apps. One limitation with any machine learning algorithms is that the patterns collected are at first empirical analysis. However, different than predictions modeled with laws from natural sciences, these patterns found are extremely temporal. My future behaviors may not have any affiliations with my past behaviors.

- 3. Predictions on map guiding applications. I find this example interesting because it does not fall any of the examples above. First, its predicting patterns is not based on laws of natural sciences, which in my opinion could approximately be considered facts. Second, the scale of traffic prediction is extremely different than personalized predictions since at a macro scale, patterns could be more predictable when modern society is regulated to be functioning in a way that is related to **social physics**. For example, Century Avenue Station will reach its passenger-flow climax at about 8:30 AM, because that is the time when people commute to their working spots, and the station is designed to serve a massive quantity of people switching subway lines.

#### Thoughts on Social Physics, collective average vs individual fate.
##### Especially on the level of scope
As Hannah Fry mentioned that statistician Quetelet developed the idea of **social physics**, as if society in a macro scale, is quantifiable and patterns could be find as general facts. Similar to what I was saying in [reading response 1](reading-response-1/reading-response-1.md), I believe this leads to a generally more regulated society, and a more regulated society will indeed fits the models predicted better. Yet this only works if the perspectives are set at the most macro scope. Individuals do not exist in this scope. Social activities are natural sciences, as if running a simulation twice with the same parameters will get the exact same results. This problem with scope is consistent in *Minority Report* and *The Crime Machine*. Indeed, **PreCrime** eliminated most of the crimes in the society, but nothing is comparable with the paranoia that Anderton had when he is captured by the prediction, hilariously and determined, and nothing is comparable when NYPD police officers are obliged to "capture criminals" that are only seen as criminals in a broken system that takes too much effort to tear down.
